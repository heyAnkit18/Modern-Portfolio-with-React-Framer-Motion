                <p>
                    I am a passionate Full Stack Developer with a specialization in the MERN stack, dedicated to building dynamic, user-centric web applications. With expertise in both front-end and back-end technologies, I've successfully developed projects such as a Video Sharing Platform, University Portal, and Event Booking Application. My 8-month internship at 10X Academy in Hyderabad provided hands-on experience, sharpening my ability to create scalable and high-performance solutions. Driven by a love for solving real-world problems through technology, I constantly strive to deliver innovative and impactful results. By leveraging modern tools and frameworks, I ensure that my applications are both efficient and future-proof. My journey is fueled by continuous learning, adapting to emerging trends, and pushing the boundaries of what's possible in web development.
